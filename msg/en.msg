If 'Rebate' is ticked the item is considered a deduction value in percent (in the field 'Price' enter a percentage without the % sign, e.g. 5.5). Any rebate will be deduced form the sum total when billed.\n\nIf the field 'Expenditure' is ticked (e.g. for an article 'train ride'), it will be listed as a separate deducible item in the invoice. As such it is not liable to VAT does not figure as income."
